:Screenshot Method in General

File src =((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.File);

FileUtils.copyfile(src, new file("Path_Of_Destination_Folder"));

:Screenshot on failure (Make a method in general base class-Apache common IO- import this package if selenium version doesnt help with FileUtils)

method_name(String testcasename, Webdriver driver);
TakesScreenshot td=(TakesScreenshot) driver;
File source= td.getSCreenshotAs(OutputTyple.file);
String destination= System.getProperty("user.dir")+"\\"Testcasename"\+".png"
FileUtils.copyFile(src, new file(destination));

Listener method for failed methods

WebDriver driver=null;
String TestCName= results.getMethod().getMethodName();
mathod_name_method written in base class(TestMName, driver) [This will surrond in try and catch]
-Now will access the driver as a field for the class so that we can connect driver accordingly to listener & back to base class as well

driver= (WebDriver---cast it this way)result.getTestClass().getRealClass().getDeclaredField("driver").get(result.getInstance()); [This will also go into try n catch]

-Just mention the listenere in xml file after suite and you are done


:Extend Reporting
-ExtendSparkReporter, ExtendReports are two method used for extend report creation where sparkreporter is used to config

String path= System.getProperty("user.dir")+"\\reports"+"reports.html";

ExtendSparkReporter sr= new ExtendSparkReporter (path);
sr.config().seReportName("passs it");
sr.config().seDocumentTitle("pass it");

extent= new ExtenReports();
extend.attachReported(reporter);
extent.setSystemInfo("Tester","Rahul Sharma");


-We should link the Extent Report utility with listener method of TestStart
-Make the method as static with initializing the object as well as static
-Call the method with class_name in listeners at class variable/global to be accessed in start method
-use that in listener start method with global variable
-Extent test= extent.createTest("result.getMethod().getMethodName()") [make this extent test also as global so that all can access]
-flush extent in onFinish method in listener
-On Testsuccess- Use test.log(Status.PASS, "Test Passed")

-On Test Failure
test.fail(result.throwable);
