:Access links in a page with control click action
-Use keys.chord(Keys.Control,Keys.Enter)- save it in a variable and iterate through the //a tag (which is holding WebElements) and use send keys to hit the above saved variable which will open the links in a new tab

:Switching to different Windows
-Store the driver.getWindowHandles in a Set which will store all the windows in one set and then using iterator & .next() you can get the element accordingly (Initally the iterator is at the top which is not pointing to anything then .next() will move to first element-like this you can save the item in a variable & then switch accordingly)

:Frames
-driver.switch_to_frame(id)
-driver.switch_to_default_content

:Calendar handling general method
-Find the generic path for month on the calendar
-run while loop for desired month(!driver.findele.gettext.contains(month)){
click the next arrow for the month}

-So until desired month is achieved it will keep on moving to the next month
-Once month find
-Take the days in a list with a generic path & iterate through the list & simply put the condition to match the desired vs expected date & perform click
-Desired date is selected


:Accept certifications
-DesiredCapabilities dc= new DesiredCapabilities .chrome();
dc.setCapibility(CapibilityType.AcceptInsec Cert, true);
dc.setCapibility(CapibilityType.AcceptSSL Cert, true);

ChromeOptions c= new ChromeOptions();
c.mrge(dc);
-now parse c as argument in your webdriver & it will perfomr all such operations desired

:Cookie 
-you can delete cookie/all cookie/add cookie using driver.manage.use all such keyboards to perfomr cokoie related actions
