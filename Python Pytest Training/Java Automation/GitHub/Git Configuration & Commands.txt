--Create a folder for local repository in your drive

--move to location of git
--git init

--git status (to check what is pending to be commited)

--git add .

--git commit -m "your message"

--git remote add origin 'repo url'

--git push origin master

--git clone 'clone url from repo click clone and get the url'

--make some changes if you want after cloning and working and perform the same operation to push the code bu adding,commiting and pushing

--git pull origin master

--Branching concept
--git checkout -b branchname (New branch creation)

--To know in which branch you are into
:git branch (it will total branches and highlights the one you are working on)

--Now make the changes to commit n push and all which will be done on the same branch until you change it'

--git checkout branchname (switched to branch)

:Merge
--git checkout master
--git pull origin master (just to make sure we have the latest code)

--git merge branch_name

:Merge Conflicts
-This mostly happens when git is not able to decide which version of the file is correct during the merging because one of the file is modified by a person which doesn't has the same version as the other person do
So in that case it will say clearly which file has a conflict & then whosever is the owner of the file should coordinate & then resolve the conflicts
