:Serialization- Process of converting your java object into Request body(Payload)

-Basically, You will be creating class and setting up getters and setters methods for your variables as per your Json and then you can simply use that class object into .body('object_name') and all your payload will be used like this which is nothing but Serialization and when opposite process happens , It is called Deserialization

-All this is done using POJO classes

-Setters plays role in serialization and getters in Deserialzation

-External Libraries required: Jackson Databind maven, Jackson2, Gson (Only .jar file should be dowbloaded), jackson core and jackson annotations also need to be downloaded with the same version as inital jackson databind
-Gson library .jar download- Prefer stable version
-Add all the .jars in Java Build Path
