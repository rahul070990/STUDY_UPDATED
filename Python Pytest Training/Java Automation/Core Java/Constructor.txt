:Constructor (Default constructor as it does not has any argument)

-Whenever an object is created for a class- A block of code is executed which is Constructor- Even if you do not define any constructor it will be automatically called by java compiler

--Constructor is used to initialize/assign the variables values
Ex- Common example can be seen when we create POM (page objects) then to make a connection between main test case & page object we pass the instance of browser which will then form a connection

--Constructor name is always same as Class Name & it does not have any return type

syntax:

public class Test(){

public Test(){

}

}
