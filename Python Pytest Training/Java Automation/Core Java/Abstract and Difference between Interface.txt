::Abstraction

:When the class has both the methods i.e: implemented/non implemented then we can say that we are having abstraction where the unimplemented method is abstract method & class is also called Abstraction class

:There is partial abstraction acheived in abstraction as compared to 100% achieved in Interface

:abstract keyword is used with method/class

:Use inheritance concept to extend the absctract class

:You cannot create object for a class which is marked as abstarct class

:private is not allowed to be used as access modifier for a method (public/protected is allowed- Not sure of the default type)

:same for variables as above as well
