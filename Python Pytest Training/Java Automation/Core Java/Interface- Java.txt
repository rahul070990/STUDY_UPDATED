:Interface- Interface is a concept in Java where only signatures are mentioned (method) and nothing can be written within the method at all.

:Classes which will use Interface should implements Interface (should write body for the method mentioned in Interface)

:implements keyoword is used to start implementing the methods of interface (WebDriver , Listener is an example of Interface)

:Access modifier should be public for all methods/variables as these methods needs to be overriden in one class which is implementing interface else you cannot implement those methods if access modifier is private,protected,default

:Variables must be public,static,final

:You can also define your own other methods in class which is implementing the interface after overriding the methods of Interface

:Concept of Run Time polymorphism:
-The return type will have the access of all the methods within that & cannot access others

-interclass itc= new class()
itc.mthods only of interclass , cannot access of new class()

-Run time polymorphism is also used when say client wants to view/access only the interface methods in which he is interested into

:One class can implement multiple interfaces as well using comma

: Interface achieves 100% abstraction
