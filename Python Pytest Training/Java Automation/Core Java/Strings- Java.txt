Strings- Collection of characters and String is a class:

There are 2 types of Strings:
1. String Literals
syntax:

str a='Rahul' (This will also be converted to Str a = new Str() in the backend by java but this is more easy to use , Also when say another str is created with syntax str b='Rahul'-- Then since both the Strings are same-Java will not create another ref of b it will point the reference of a-- This is used more likely in Java)

2. By object creation:
syntax-

str a= new str('Sharma') [As discussed above, This follows the standard format of creating a string & even if a new str with same value is created still new reference will be created in this case- This is less likely being used in Java]


String methods:
str.charAt(index)
str.indexof(char)
str.split(char)= This will split the string in 2 parts  & you can store in array & then print it or use it as per the indexing

str.substring(startIndex,EndIndex)
str.substring(startIndex) [From that index to the last]
str.conact(strtobe added) [This will join 2 strings]
str.toUpperCase()
str.toLowerCase()
str.replace(char_tobreplaced, char_tobereplaced_wtih)

:String Buffer and Builder- used for string manupulation
String Buffer is thread safe, less efficiemt
String Builder is not thread safe, more efficient
