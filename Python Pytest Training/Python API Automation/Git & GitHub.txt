-------------------------
Git commands for inital setup:

GIT (local repo)-
-Make a dir/folder where you need to setup your local git
-Within that folder- Place/Paste your files/code to be pushed
-Now go to folder path & enter git bash & hit enter

Sequence of commands to be executed-
-git init (creates the local repo)
-git status (to check what files are available for untracked,staged, tracked- These are the 3 stages in which file is: Initially all the files be in untrack stage so to go to next stage- Do this)
-git add ./--all (This will stag all the files- If you want to do any specific file then the name of the file)
-git commit -m "Message for commit" (tracked stage/enter the commit message)

-git remote add origin https://github.com/rahul070990/PythonPytestTutorial.git (This will add the origin of the repo in which push needs to be done- Once the new repo is generated, There will be a link which can be used in this command to set the origin)

-git push origin master/git push -u origin master (this will actually push the files to Github:: Before this- First Step: Create a repo on Github & taje the link created & then use that link to set the origin & finally push the files to GitHub)

-Due to the use of HCL Laptop- I was facing issue for pushing the code but afterwards used SSH  method instead of https)
-Created & added ssh key as well

SSh key can be created with:
