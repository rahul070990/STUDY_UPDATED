:::::WHAT IS FIXTURE & HOW WE USE THEM?
Fixtures are used say whenever you need to perform some Setup/Teardown method then you can use Fixtures
Setup--    Always executed before the start of the Test Case (Ideally used as you have to start up Browser everytime before a Test Case)

TearDown-- Always after the test case has been executed (Ideally when closing a browser)

-----Declare it once only for 'Setup' & then use yield for Teardown (When yield is used after that it is considered to be executed after the test has been executed)

--We can import pytest & use it as @pytest.fixture (That is marked as fixture)

:::::HOW TO PASS THE FIXTURE?
-----It can be done simply by passing it in the Argument


:::::WHAT IS CONFTEST?
It is used generally to declare the fixture from where automatically that is available for all the pytest file in that directory(always use it as same name 'conftest.py)) & then you can use it like:

--Say you want to implemenet fixture at a class level from where it is accessible for allthe methods within that:
pytest.mark.usefixture("setup") [This helps using the setup for all the test cases in the class]

pytest.fixture(scope="class") [With this it will run only once before the class & once after the end test case)

:::::::PARAMETERIZING USING FIXTURE?
--Define it in conftest.py like:

pytest.fixture(params=("chrome","IE","Firefox"))
def crossBrowser(request):
	return request.param

If say for you need to send different data for different time so instead of just tuple, You can send it in LIST containing tupple like--

pytest.fixture(params=[("chrome","data1","data2"),("IE","data3","data4"),"Firefox"))]
def crossBrowser(request):
	return request.param
--Call the method whereever you want it afterwards

:::::::::HOW TO GENERATE HTML REPORT?
---------pip install pytest-html

---------pytest --html=report.html
